Vehical-Routing-Problem
=======================

Vehical Routing Problem solver.
This is a small program which is able to solve VRP using two basic alogirthms:
- Sweep algorithm
- Clark & Wright's algorithm.

There are two versions. One written in Java, which runs as console applications and another one which is also written in Java but compiled to JavaScript using GWT.
The GWT version uses Google Maps in order to visualize the results.

You can get some more info about the tool at my blog page:

The working GWT version of the application is available here:
